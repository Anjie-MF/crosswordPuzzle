To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [The Word Finder](https://www.thewordfinder.com/crossword-puzzle-maker/) - Used the form to generate my own crossword puzzle, which significantly helped in ensuring that the words fit well together and in providing a solid wireframe for the puzzle.
